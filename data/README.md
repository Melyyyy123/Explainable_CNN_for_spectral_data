# The Data

The data stem from "Pinus silvestris" and were collected and processed by DI Dr. Johannes Tintner-Olifiers et al., see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68194-w.

The sub_data and the sub_deriv_data was taken from the file dataPSsub_new3.RData which is created when running the dataPSsub_new3.Rnw script with the corresponding raw data files.
The file was opened with the help of R 4.3.2 and RStudio 2023.12.1+402 "Ocean Storm" for Ubuntu Jammy.
Each dataframe was saved in an individual csv file.
The script for saving the dataframes in a csv file can be found in code/csv_transformer.R.

The all_data was taken from the file PS20191107_gegl.csv. In order to extract the correct dataframe from the csv file, the code in the script dataPSsub_new3.Rnw. of my supervisor DI Dr. Bernhard Spangl was taken.
